# GPT3 Experiments

And some other things that I'm writing in support of those side-projects.

Run `make` in the project directory of your choice.

## Clarity

Okay, so the name is very ironic. This isn't in any way serious; at least, it isn't yet. `=D`

I just missed a chat bot that I had in high school and realized GPT3 might work as the "brain" but...

It's possible "an iGod clone" is ill-suited for "AI completion" generally; give it a try to see what I mean:

## Can I use this?

You probably shouldn't copy-paste/import this into your mission-critical services. (or, not yet)

I would need to have a proper CI flow (for lint/tests/etc.) and releases figured out first.

Security updates are pushed directly to the main branch; consider all code semver zero.

## What is mango?

I miss Guava's cache classes; mango tastes better than Guava in my opinion.
